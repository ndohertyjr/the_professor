## Mentor System - dattpatel99:
*To encourage helping others and appriciating those who helped*
- Each user is a mentor and a student
- Each user starts with common number of points reset at the end of each college term.
- Each user can give mentor points and receive mentor points
- Initially: Points are transfered through bot commands using student username and mentor username. 
  _ In future maybe we can implment passing of points through messages in a channel using emojis.
- THERE IS NO RANKING OR COMPARING SYSTEM. 
- This is purely for a user to track how much knowledge has improved, how helpful they have been or how enthusiastic they have been to ask and learn something new.
